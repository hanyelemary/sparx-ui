Sparx UI
========

A light-weight UI framework for creating responsive, future-friendly and accessible web apps. Use it for rapid prototyping or production-grade applications. http://sparxui.com

Guiding Principles
==================

## Accessibility:

ARIA roles and landmarks included on widgets.
Regular accessibility tests, WCAG 2.0 Level AA and Section 508 compliant.

## Performance:
Rich widgets with small payload.
The framework will NOT grow beyond 10 kb minified + gzipped.

## Technical Excellence:
Built on top of SMACSS principles. 
Content-first and progressive enhancement drive our work. 


Browser Support:
================

The idea behind SparxUI was to build a forward-looking framework that follows progressive enhancement. Meaning, SparxUI will provide a baseline experience for older browsers such as IE7 and IE8, while enhancing the experience drastically for modern browsers. 

SparxUI was never meant to achieve design parity or fix browser-specific quirks. It was simply built on top of web standards … If your browser supports them, so will SparxUI. Period. End of story.
